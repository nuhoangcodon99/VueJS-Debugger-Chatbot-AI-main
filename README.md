# CHATBOT AI DEBUG ASSISTANT

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### I use Vue Router, Pinia, Vuetify, @mdi/font, and socket.io-client, so make sure to install all these libraries via npm.
```
npm install vue-router@latest pinia vuetify @mdi/font socket.io-client
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

## In this app, you gotta login to your account to access the Chatbot homepage. If you try to access the homepage link while not logged in, you will still be redirected to the login page!

## You can create a new message by creating a new chat and then pasting that message into the newly created chat.

## If you reach this 404 page, it means the page you're looking for doesn't exist. You can easily return to the homepage by clicking the "Go to Home" button. The page design is modern and includes a smooth animation effect for a better user experience.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using modern web development technologies:

- **Vue 3**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications (SPA).  
- **Pinia**: A state management library, providing a simple and intuitive way to manage global state in Vue applications.  
- **Vuetify**: A Material Design-based UI library, ensuring a clean and responsive design.  
- **Vue Router**: Handles routing and navigation between different views or components in the application.  
- **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server using WebSocket.  
- **Material Design Icons**: A collection of beautiful and consistent icons for enhancing the user interface.

These technologies combine to create a fast, responsive, and dynamic user experience.
